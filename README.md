# FlickrResearch
FlickrResearch provides methods for data extraction from the Flickr API. It encapsulates the functionality of Pandas and FlickrAPI to allow users to extract their own metadata for Flickr photos. This module extracts text metadata only, no images. Users with basic Python skills can write their own routines to pull, clean, manage and save data.
