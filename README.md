# FlickrResearch
FlickrResearch provides methods for data extraction from the Flickr API.  GIS researchers can use FlickrResearch to extract their own metadata for Flickr photos. This project extracts text metadata only, no images. Users with basic Python skills can write their own routines to pull, clean, manage, and save data. This code was used for research conducted by Colleen Metcalf, Tracy Michaud and Matthew Bampton at the University of Southern Maine.
